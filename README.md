# Covid19-Forecasting-Task

This study aims at 2 main goals: 1) performing a time series forecasting task based on trends of daily new cases and new deaths data before major vaccination rollouts, in order to predict how these trends will develop without any vaccinations present; 2) comparing predicted trends to actual data in order to analyze the effects of Covid-19 vaccinations. 

(Data is collected from the Our Word in Data Covid19 database.)
